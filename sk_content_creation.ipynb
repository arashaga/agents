      "#### **1. Overview of Inflation Trends in the US Leading into 2025**\n",
      "- Inflation rates remain a hot topic as the US economy transitions into 2025. While the federal efforts in 2024 tapered inflation somewhat, it still remains above historical averages.\n",
      "- Key contributing factors include geopolitical uncertainties, lingering supply chain issues, and price stickiness in specific sectors like housing and energy.\n",
      "- Tools like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions will steer inflation trends, with speculation that rate cuts might occur depending on economic growth and labor market data.\n",

      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "- **Sticky inflation**: Despite early signs of cooling, inflationary pressures hold steady above 2%.\n",
